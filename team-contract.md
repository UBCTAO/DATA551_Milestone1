# Team Work Contract

## Team Members
- Wei Li  
- Tao Wang  

## Work Distribution
- Work will be divided primarily by dashboard components:
  - One member focuses on **data pipeline and backend metrics** (data cleaning, feature engineering, model outputs, monitoring metrics).
  - The other focuses on **frontend layout and visualizations** (Dash layout, Altair charts, interactions).
- Each member is expected to contribute **roughly equal effort** over the whole project. We will track contributions using GitHub commits, issues, and pull requests.
- If a task turns out to be significantly more time-consuming than expected, the other team member will help rebalance the workload **before** the milestone deadline.

## Communication
- **Primary channels:** Discord / WeChat for daily async updates.
- **Core working hours:** Monday–Saturday, **4:00–9:00 PM PST**. Sunday is reserved as a rest day unless both members explicitly agree otherwise.
- **Response time:** During core working hours, we aim to respond to project-related messages **within 2–4 hours**.
- **Meetings:** At least **two synchronous working sessions per week** (minimum 1.5 hours each), scheduled at the beginning of each week.
- **Async stand-ups:** Each working day, we will send a short text update covering:
  - What I did yesterday
  - What I plan to do today
  - Any blockers or help needed

## Working Style
- We prefer **deep work blocks**. Non-urgent messages should be batched and sent outside of clearly announced focus sessions.
- All code changes go through pull requests with at least **one review** before merging into `main`, unless we are pair-programming synchronously and both agree on the change.
- Each PR should be **small and focused** (ideally one feature, fix, or refactor per PR) to make review easier and safer.

## Quality Standards
- Code must run without errors (at least on the provided sample data) before opening a PR.
- All Altair charts must have:
  - Meaningful titles
  - Proper axis labels (with units where appropriate)
  - Clear legends when multiple series are shown
- Written deliverables (proposal, reflections, README sections) must be **proofread once** before submission.
- **Target grade:** 90+ on each milestone. We will not sacrifice sleep or health for marginal gains beyond that.

## Availability
- **Wei Li:**  
  - Available: Monday–Saturday, 4:00–9:00 PM PST  
  - Not available: Sunday (and outside the core working hours unless agreed in advance)
- **Tao Wang:**  
  - Available: Monday–Saturday, 4:00–9:00 PM PST  
  - Not available: Sunday (and outside the core working hours unless agreed in advance)

If either member’s availability changes (e.g., exams, interviews, travel), they will notify the other **at least one week in advance** whenever possible.

## Conflict Resolution
1. First, discuss the issue openly and respectfully within 24 hours after it is noticed.
2. If we cannot reach an agreement, we will ask the TA or instructor for mediation.
3. If a team member repeatedly fails to meet commitments, this will be documented and reflected honestly in the Team Reflection and peer evaluation.

## Accountability
- Missing an agreed deadline **without prior communication** will be noted and discussed in the next meeting.
- If one member is struggling with a task (technically or time-wise), they must communicate this at least **48 hours before** the milestone deadline so we can redistribute work or adjust scope.
- We commit to giving each other **honest but respectful feedback**, focusing on behavior and process, not on personality.
